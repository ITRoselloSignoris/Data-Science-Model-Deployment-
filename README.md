# Model Deployment with FastAPI
Project made for Data Science & MLOPS Bootcamp from Edvai
## Project description
In this project I built a Random Forest Classification model that predicts wether the water is potable or not based on next 9 variables: eee. This model is deployed with FastAPI on a local server.

## Methods used
- Data visualization
- Data processing
- Model development
- Model evaluation
- Model deployment with API 
## Technologies
- <ins>**Model Training**</ins>: pandas, funpymodeling, sklearn
- <ins>**Api**</ins>: FastAPI, uvicorn, requests, 
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

Clone repo ...

2. Install the libraries inside the requirements.txt:

pip install ...

3. Run the "main.py" file to Â¿Run the server?  "python main.py":

python main.py

4. Run the "call_api.py" file to call the api: 
 
python call_api.py 


## Results
### Confusion Matrix

### ROC curve

## To-Do list
- [ ] Make and save model's validation error plots
- [ ] Add ROC curve and Confusion Matrix plots in the README.md file
